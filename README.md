# Employees_Dataset_Analysis

 Employees Data Exploration and Analysis with MYSQL
 The idea of analysing the Employees_Dataset is to get the overview of employees satisfaction within the organization.
 Employees_Dataset consist of more than 10000 rows with columns and tables such as t_salaries, t_department, first_name,last_name, gender, hire date,emp_no and many more...

 While Exploring Data with SQL, I was working on the following things...

 - Checked all the details of table such column name, data types and constraints
 - Checked for duplicate values in [emp_no] column
 - Removed unwanted columns from table
 - Merged 2 differnt tables and added the new column of Country_Name with the help of primary key
 - Counted the no.of employees by using count functions
 - Checked min,max,sum salary of employees
 - Created new category column for rating
